# ICD10-Webscrape
Object Oriented script to pull all ICD10 codes from https://www.icd10data.com

Object oriented script resulting in 67,000+ ICd10 codes with their corresponding descriptions.  This is unfortunately missing a few S codes that dive deep into XXX categories.  Imperfect script that serves well, should an individual need this codelist with descriptions! (GEMS files lack descriptions!)
